# CVE-2021-4034
This is my own implementation of CVE-2021-4034 also known as pwnkit. Unlike other automated exploits of CVE-2021-4034 this implementation does not download any additional payloads and is contained all within one easy to transfer file.



## Usage
This exploit has no cli options but it does check if the system is vulnerable and has all the require external commands. To use it just transfer the compiled binary to a writable folder on the target machine and make it executable.
```shell
$ chmod +x pwnkit
```
### Example 1
```shell
./pwnkit
[+] Testing to see if machine is vulnerable
[-] This machine is not vulnerable to pwnkit
[-] Exiting
```
### Example 2
```shell
$ whoami
tester
$ ./pwnkit
